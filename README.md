________________________________________
Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analysis sales and customer data using SQL to understand customer behaviour, sales trends, and business performance.
The project focuses on writing efficient SQL queries to extract actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.

o	Order ID, Order Date
o	Product Category, Product Name
o	Sales Amount, Quantity, Profit
________________________________________
Tools & Technologies Used
•	Database Language: SQL
•	Concepts Used:
o	SELECT, WHERE
o	GROUP BY, HAVING

Data Preparation
•	Checked for missing or inconsistent values
•	Ensured correct relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys
•	Validated data types for numerical and date columns
•	Used joins to combine customer and sales data accurately
________________________________________
Analysis Performed
•	Analysed total and average sales per customer
•	Identified top-performing customers and regions
•	Calculated order frequency and customer purchase behaviour
•	Evaluated category-wise and product-wise sales performance
•	Identified repeat vs one-time customers
________________________________________
Key Insights
•	A small group of customers contributed to a large percentage of total sales
•	Certain regions consistently outperformed others in revenue
•	Repeat customers generated higher average order value
•	Specific product categories showed stable demand across time periods
________________________________________
Final Output
•	SQL query results displaying:
o	Customer-wise sales summary
o	Region-wise revenue analysis
o	Top products and customers
•	Clean, well-structured SQL scripts for analysis

Business Recommendations
•	Focus retention strategies on high-value repeat customers
•	Invest more in high-performing regions and categories
•	Design targeted offers for low-frequency customers
•	Use customer segmentation to improve sales strategies
